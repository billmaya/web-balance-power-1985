                            drawMap()               Complete map drawn except for mini-map outlines using SVG. Individual countries highlighted on mouseover (though Continental US
                                                    Alaska not highlighted at same time). Also, highlighting is erratic depending on how you cross the border.

                            drawMap_NEW()           Draws just US, Canada, and Mexico. Extraneous line between Continental US and Alaska. Both Continental US and Alaska highlighted
                                                    at same time on mouseover.

                            drawMap_NEWER()         Believe this was an attempt to use SVG moveto (M) and lineto (L) to avoid drawing line between non-contiguous sections of a single
                                                    country.
